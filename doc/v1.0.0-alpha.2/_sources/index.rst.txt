``pyramid_oereb`` is an open-source implementation of the server side
part for the swiss `"Cadastre of Public-law Restrictions on
landownership"
(PLR-cadastre) <https://www.cadastre.ch/en/oereb.html>`__.

It is written in Python and designed as a plugin for the `Pyramid Web
Framework <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/>`__.
This allows ``pyramid_oereb`` to be included in any Pyramid web
application.

If you are planning to run an own instance of ``pyramid_oereb``, we suggest to read the sections
:ref:`installation` and :ref:`configuration` to get started.

Architecture
------------

The application is separated into different layers to provide different points to hook into it for easier
customization.
